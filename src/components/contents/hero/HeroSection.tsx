          ðŸ‘‹ This is Dom, a software engineer whoâ€™s been piecing together the
          tech puzzle for a good while now. I like to think of myself as someone
          who connects the dots and turns ideas into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Iâ€™m not just about coding. Iâ€™m a problem solver at heart, and I
          love figuring things out, whether itâ€™s tech-related or not. When Iâ€™m
          not working, Iâ€™m probably out exploring new places, trying different
          foods, and collecting stories from the people I meet.
